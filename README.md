# coms319_assignment03

- do an "npm install i" from the coms319_assignment03/app directory before starting
- there is an issue where adding products from forms does not show the image on the website, and I cannot figure out why
- there is an additional weird bug where requesting a product by id the status on the frontend is always 200 even when the backend says status 404. I found a work around to still display the error to the user, but it's kiind of bugging me why.
- There is not a good way to share my mongoDB info, so just follow the setup steps in the assignment doc and either add the documents from the json snippet below (or   where I got them from) one by one in mongo, or save a json of products outside of the project and feed it into mongo
- feel free to test stuff and let me know if anything is broken
